# Analytics Case Studies

I have created this repo to showcase my technical skills and capabilities. 

This repo is comprised of a number of case studies that I have completed whilst applying for roles within the Analytics space. 

The intention is to showcase my analytical capabilities including skills such as:

These case studies have been anonymised to protect the companies, and any data included has been anonymised.
