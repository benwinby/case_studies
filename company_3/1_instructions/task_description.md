# Task Description

## Purpose 
This assignment has been designed to give you an opportunity to face scenarios that you would encounter on a daily basis if selected for this role. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of the marketing analytics space and your problem solving ability. 

## Scope 
The assignment is designed to take ~2 hours to complete. We’re not expecting you to ‘solve’ the challenges we pose and give us a detailed step-by-step plan. Instead we are interested to see what factors you would consider, what decisions would have to be made and how you would make those decisions. 

## Audience 
If you are selected for the next interview round, you will be presenting your results to marketing analysts and leads. 

## Output 
The tools you use and how you want to present your results is up to you - just be aware that we will need to be able to assess the results without you presenting them first before you present them on a Zoom call in the next round. 

## Assessment 
The exact assessment criteria are not available, but are clearly defined. If you wish - regardless of the outcome of the assessment - we can provide you with feedback on your results. 

## Questions 
You can ask questions via email if needed, but to be fair to all candidates, we may not be able to answer. Be aware that it may take a few hours to respond and that we only respond during business hours. 
Good luck, we are excited to see your results!

# Tasks

## Scenario 1 
*~45 minutes*

The audio marketing team has been running podcast advertisements in the USA for the last 3 years. They assess & optimize the success of their channel as a user acquisition tool by looking at the number of customers who respond ‘I heard about you on a show’ on our ‘How Did You Hear About Us?’ survey. The survey gets sent to each newly signed up customer and the response rate is 9.35%. 

They also look at customers who we do not have customer-level tracking for and pro-rata the results of the survey: if 5% of survey respondents choose the ‘I heard about you on a show’ response, 5% of the customers without customer-level tracking get attributed to the audio channel. 

The team is encountering two major challenges: 
1) They don’t know which sponsored shows are working well and which aren’t - they assume that a small number of shows drive the majority of users but have no way of verifying this and shifting investment towards these shows 
2) If the team adds up the prorated numbers and the number of users who respond ‘I heard about you on a show’, it looks like they’ve been growing the number of customers acquired by 20% quarter-on-quarter. But there are strong fluctuations in the data week-on-week: in some weeks a single digit number of extra ‘I heard about you on a show’ responses cause them to see a huge spike in prorated new customers. Because of this, they are wary of the methodology and they are not comfortable with increasing investment in audio advertisement at the same pace of 20% 
quarter-on-quarter and growing into new regions. 

### Questions

What actions do you suggest that would enable the team to double their year-on-year new user acquisition growth rate? 

How would you calculate the validity of pro-rating the survey results - what numbers would you need to have access to? 

In absence of customer-level tracking, what other metrics would you advise the teams to optimize to? 

How would you improve the number of customer-level tracked users? 

What else would you do? 


## Scenario 2 
*~75 minutes*

The Paid Display team has started running activity with broad targeting across France, using a creative that includes no CTA and is aimed at communicating our brand feel instead of explaining product details. Most of the activity gets delivered via the Google Display Network. 

Like in Scenario 1, there is a response option aimed at capturing the impact of Paid Display activity in the ‘How Did You Hear About Us?’ survey. The number of those responses has not increased in France since the campaign was launched.

In comparison to their other (more product focused) ads, the team has seen only very few clicks from customers and the conversion rate to sign-up of those who click is lower, too. 

This has kicked off a discussion in the marketing tribe. Some people think that the activity should be turned off because it is not performing well and would rather see the budget get shifted to other campaigns with narrower targeting and a CTA. 
Others argue that:
1. most of the effect of this campaign is view-through, not click-through by the nature of the channel. So although we don’t see many clicks, they argue that most people who get impacted by the ads don’t click on them 
2. this is a ‘brand’ campaign and shouldn’t be held to the same short-term activation metrics as ‘direct response’ campaigns. They see the effect of this campaign more long-term 
3. other channels & campaigns will have increased conversion rates because it is easier to convert a user who has encountered our brand before being exposed to a direct response ad 
4. this campaign will increase product usage of existing customers more than our acquisition focused direct response ads 

### Questions

What actions can the marketing analytics team take to steer the team in a way that generates as much international cross-border money volume flowing through the company as possible? 

What do you think about the arguments made in favour of leaving the activity running - how would you verify if they hold true? 

Would you make changes to attribution/measurement/KPIs to optimize to? 

What information would you need and what analysis would you run to give your opinion on how to handle the activity?
